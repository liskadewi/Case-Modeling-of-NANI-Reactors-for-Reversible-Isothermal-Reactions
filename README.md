# Case-Modeling-of-NANI-Reactors-for-Reversible-Isothermal-Reactions

This project focused on optimizing a Non-Adiabatic Non-Isothermal (NANI) reactor for an exothermic gas-phase reaction. I developed a model to simulate the relationship between temperature and reactant conversion along the reactor length. The model incorporated heat transfer effects and the reaction's heat generation, accounting for a "hotspot" phenomenon. By optimizing the reactor length, the project aimed to achieve maximum reactant conversion while maintaining a controlled temperature profile. This approach ensures efficient reaction progress and optimal product quality by mitigating potential issues like side reactions or product degradation.
